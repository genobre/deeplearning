# Time Series

This project is a study of the Deep Learning Integrated Course Program offered by DeepLearning.AI and hosted at Coursera. I also use some other resources to write the content contained here, as the book Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville and the book Artificial Intelligence, a Modern Approach, by Stuart Russel and Peter Norvig. In here I discuss the foundational concepts of neural networks and deep learning, hyperparameter tuning, convolutional neural networks, among others.

Some of the codes available here are based on the code tutorial in the course, with some minor additions, and other are autoral. 

You will find the following sections:

1. Basics
   - Logistic Regression
   - Vectorization
